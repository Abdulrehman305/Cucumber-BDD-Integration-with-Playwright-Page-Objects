# Cucumber BDD Integration with Playwright Page Objects
This project demonstrates how to build a scalable end-to-end testing framework by integrating Cucumber (BDD) with Playwright using the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.

Key Features
âœ… Cucumber BDD: Write human-readable test scenarios using Gherkin syntax for better collaboration between QA, developers, and stakeholders.
âœ… Playwright: Fast and reliable automation for web applications across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
âœ… Page Object Model (POM): Organized and reusable code structure for maintainable test suites.
âœ… Cross-Browser Testing: Execute tests seamlessly on multiple browsers.
âœ… Parallel Execution: Faster test runs with Playwrightâ€™s parallelization.
âœ… Jenkins Integration: Continuous Integration setup to run tests automatically on code commits.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
Language: TypeScript / JavaScript
Test Runner: Cucumber.js
Automation Tool: Playwright
Framework Design: Page Object Model (POM)

ðŸ”¹ How It Works
Write feature files in Gherkin format.
Map feature steps to step definitions in Playwright.
Use Page Object classes to encapsulate UI interactions.
